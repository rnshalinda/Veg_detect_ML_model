# Veg_detect_ML_model
Machine Learning model trained to detect vegitables in Agro-industry

# A Reliable Approach to Vegitable Detection in Agriculture with **YOLO**v5

### ðŸŒŸ Conclution :



*    After thorough comparison of all metrics; training loss, validation loss, and mAP
 across all models, it is evident that all the models are performing satisfactorily.

*    However, upon inspecting the predicted images, two models stood out for their exceptional detection accuracy and minimal false positives.
